## Description

WinDirStat is a program that allows you to find drive space hogs at a glance. It achieves that by displaying a drive, drives or directories in a [treemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemap) that assigns bigger areas to bigger files and directories. Making those areas visually separate by coloring and other means allows you to see literally at a glance what the space hogs are and where to dig deeper.

The directory tree is simultaneously shown as a tree list and as a treemap. One can effortlessly gain an impression of the proportions on the drive(s).

### Major features

* 3 views, Directory tree, Treemap and Extension list, coupled with each other
* Built-in cleanup actions including Open, Delete, Show Properties
* User-defined cleanup actions (command line based)

### Background

The original author of WinDirStat was Bernhard Seifert and it was inspired by [KDirStat](https://kdirstat.sourceforge.net/) and [SequoiaView](https://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/).
Design and many details are based on KDirStat.

### WinDirStat Alternatives on other operating systems

Meanwhile, alternatives also exist for OS X and many programs make use of treemaps for a variety of visualization needs.

The [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software) alternatives for other operating systems are thus:

* [QDirStat](https://github.com/shundhammer/qdirstat) (Linux and virtually any \*nix that runs KDE/X11)
* [Disk Inventory X](https://www.derlien.com/) (OS X)
* [GrandPerspective](https://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/) (OS X)

## Building

WinDirStat can be built with Visual Studio 2022 or later. A Visual Studio solution file can be loaded from windirstat\WinDirStat.sln.
